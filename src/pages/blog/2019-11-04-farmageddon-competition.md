description: Our code clubbers enter a new coding competition
---

This week at Code Club, we've been building our entries for the [Code Club Farmageddon competition](https://blog.codeclub.org.uk/2019/09/18/help-shaun-the-sheep-and-lu-la-in-our-global-competition/).

We had some fantastic entries (which you can see on our [online Scratch profile here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OakTreeCodeClub/)!), but our club's winner was Josh and Joe with this great animation - press the Green Flag then the spacebar to see it.

We really liked this entry, as it made fantastic use of the events available within Scratch. This let Josh and Joe change their animation much more easily, and taught us all some new techniques!

We'll now submit our entries to the national competition - fingers crossed for all our members!
