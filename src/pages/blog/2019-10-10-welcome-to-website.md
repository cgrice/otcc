## What's Code Club?

[Code Club](https://codeclub.org/en/) is a nationwide project to get 9 to 11 year olds learning the basics of computer programming. 
Oak Tree Primary School currently run a Code Club for Year 5 and 6 pupils on Mondays after school from 3.15 - 4.15pm.

Weâ€™ll be using software called [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/ ) which you can download at home for free.

Scratch makes it really easy to create fun, creative games whilst learning the basics of programming. Pupils will be using school equipment. CodeClub is **FREE**! 

## This Website

Oak Tree Code Club has been running for 6 years, and we thought it would be good to start
sharing some of the amazing work our students get up to.

We'll also be using this site to [share updates](/blog/), [keep everyone up to date
on when Code Club is on](/), and let people who didn't get into the code club this term 
[follow along with the projects](/projects/) at home.

Students can sign up to Code Club by....

If you want to get invovled with the code club, we're always [looking for volunteers](/get-involved/).

See you on Monday!
