    Code Club is a nationwide project to get 9 to 11 year olds learning the
    basics of computer programming. You can find out more on the website
    www.codeclub.org.uk 


    Weâ€™ll be using software called Scratch which you can download at home for
    free at http://scratch.mit.edu/ Scratch makes it really easy to create fun,
    creative games whilst learning the basics of programming. Pupils will be
    using school equipment. CodeClub is FREE! 


    Code Club normally runs on Mondays after school from 3.15 - 4.15pm.  We have
    a limit of 20 pupils. If you are interested in getting involved please
    contact the school.
