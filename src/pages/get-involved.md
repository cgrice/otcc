## Volunteers

If you'd like to help at our weekly Code Club sessions, please sign up via the
[Code Club Website](https://codeclub.org/en/volunteer), and search for Oak Tree
Primary School.

The Code Club organisation will help get you signed up, sort out DBS checks and
provide some training before you attend your first sessions.

If you're interested in coming along to see how things work before comitting, we're
happy to welcome visitors! Please contact X or Y to arrange.
